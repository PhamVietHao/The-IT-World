<p><strong>I/TEAM PROFILE</strong></p>
<p><em>1.Team Name</em></p>
<p>I want to name my team &ldquo;IT LOVERS&rdquo; since it best describes us as a group of fellows who love IT. It also reminds us of our purpose and highlights our job. I think it would be an excellent name for my future team.</p>
<p><em>2.Team Profile</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Base on the three tests that I did, I have a better insight when choosing my teammates. In my opinion, a group of three is ideal since lesser member means we can communicate and understand each other more easily. When it comes to research for knowledge, I want to find members who are good with visual learning as we have to do a lot of reading. It is also reflected from the learning style test that I am more comfortable with reading than listening. As for personality, I want to find members who are outgoing and hard-working. My nature leans forward to feeling from the MBTI test, so a member with more judgment and logic can help me decide more things. Moreover, when I approach a plan, I tend to use my review more than research; I need someone with more vision to help me carry out the project. However, finding members who fit your expectations is challenging, especially when you are in university with many strangers. So, in my opinion, the best way to make a perfect team is to work with everyone and try to be flexible in every circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>II/TOOLS</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>III/ PROJECT IDEA</strong></p>
<p><em>1.Overview</em></p>
<p>I realize a lack of information about animals, especially in Vietnam, where many people accidentally harm rare species or injured themselves. Therefore, I have developed a plan to build a mobile application that could quickly scan an animal and tell us everything about it. Moreover, it can warn the user about all the endangered species around them. Besides those main features, the app also provides other functions like an animal dictionary and a social network for the user. This app or what I called &ldquo;Bgreen&rdquo; is made in the hope that everyone will be more alarmed about our situation.</p>
<p><em>2.motivation</em></p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, I have always been drawn to wildlife. So growing up, reading the encyclopedia has become part of my childhood. But as a child, I did not realize the problems that the animal and plants are facing. Environmental destruction, over-hunting, and deforestation lead to many species losing their habitats and become extinct. With the hope that we can save many species from the verge of extinction, an idea sparks through my mind. An app that can help people understand the environment and raise their awareness. This app can replace any animal or plant encyclopedia with just a scan, and it is also an excellent tool for children to explore the world. The government can also use this app to educate everyone about environmental conservation. And lastly, the app also encourages everyone to do voluntary activities. Overall, I think this app will have a significant impact on the environment.</p>
<p><em>3/ Description</em></p>
<p>The app's first feature is object detection that can scan and give you information about animals and plants. The app will run through the database, compare the object's color and shape, and then give out the data by simply taking a picture.&nbsp; When you encounter a dangerous animal or a poisonous plant, the screen will turn red. You can contact the closest hospital or authority available on the side of the screen. The app will also give out first-aid instructions in case if something went wrong. The case goes the same with red-book animals. Still, the monitor will turn blue and immediately notify the animal wildlife conservation organizations. There is also a gallery for storing images and mark the date when the user takes the photo. Moreover, the user can write comments on the picture, and the app will show the image again after a year pass by just like Facebook memories. The first function encourages people to explore the world while providing safeness.</p>
<p>The second function of the app is a dictionary containing information about plants and animals. You can either search for information by entering the name of the species or describe its shape color. Since many animals or plants look-alike, a list of checkboxes will appear to help you sort out the one you are looking for more easily. Moreover, there will be a news section for users to update the news about the environment around the world. If you need more information, personal experience, or questions, click the chat room icon and talk with the professional. There will also be a section available for users to upload videos about their study in both animals and plants. Anyone can browse those videos to gain more knowledge, facts, and personal experience.</p>
<p>The third feature of the app is "Green Earth." "Green Earth" will track how many trees you plant or what animals you have encountered during the day and announce to you when there is a voluntary activity. Since it is also a social platform, you can share your moments when doing something good or join forums to talk with other environmental activists. Moreover, there will be a scoreboard on how much voluntary work that you have done. And to encourage more people to join, the app will give out points that you can later exchange for merchandise whenever you complete a mission.</p>
<p>The last feature of the app is a map using the phone's location. The map will show the animals in the area and alarm the user when they enter the red-book animals' habitat. Moreover, the app will also show the location where you can plant a tree or charity points. There will be a toolbar with a search engine and filter switch in case the map is too crowded and overlaps with each other. The map is essential for both the first and third functions. If the users get caught in a critical condition, the map will use the phone's location to alarm the nearest hospital. And with the help of the map, you can find the address of the voluntary activity.</p>
<p><em>4/Tool and technology</em></p>
<p>Since this smartphone app will be available in Android and IOS, I will have to use Java for Android and Swift for IOS. To build an app on Android, I will be using Android Studio, a famous software to make any Android app; it is also open-source. As for IOS, I will be using Xcode available on Mac App Store to make the version of this app on IOS. To store the data from this app, I will use Google Drive to help with keeping the information. And lastly, I will use Google Tensorflow software to train my Learning Machine.</p>
<p><em>5/ Skill required</em></p>
<p>Since this is only my first year at RMIT, Carrying out this project might be very difficult because of the lack of knowledge and skill. But with a clear goal, I can acquire all the skills and knowledge needed through program electives at RMIT. In my previous semester, I have learned about user-centered design and database management which can help me design this app. And in the future, I will have to learn and master Java and Swift programming languages to make this app available on Android and IOS. Moreover, understand data structure and algorithms is essential for this project. As for Machine Learning and Cloud Computing, there are also classes for them, but I think it would take a lot of time to master any of these techniques.</p>
<p><em>6/outcome</em></p>
<p>If this project is successful, it will have a significant impact on wildlife reservations. The more people understand about animals, especially red book animals, the more people will be aware of the situation we face. Our Earth is in a critical condition, many animals have become extinct, and the Earth has become more polluted than ever; it is time to educate everyone about the environment. It is also an excellent tool for kids to explore the outside world instead of spending much time at home. Not only it helps kids exercise more it is also a great way to gain more knowledge. Furthermore, through this app, the government can prevent the citizen from accidentally killing endangered animals.&nbsp; And lastly, with the "green Earth" function, more trees will be planting and help re-greening the barren hills. In conclusion, changing the world requires a lot of money and effort but I believe with the success of "Bgreen" we can turn the Earth into a better place.</p>
<p><strong>IV/FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<p>As this is just a plan, there might be errors and problems that I overlook. So to get more insight into the project, I have consulted with two other students in our class.</p>
<p>Duong My Uyen &ndash; s3904418</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find your project is cool and practical. Moreover, it is written in great detail. We all know that currently, the illegal hunting of rare animals is widespread. Animals can become extinct by humans. So I think it's fantastic that this app can scan animals and give out information about them like that; people will know which animals need to be protected and can better understand their behavior and habitats. Also, I think the description should give some pictures to make it easier to visualize the UI of the app. However, taking pictures of such animals will sometimes also annoy them, for example, shooting with the flash on, which may be harmful to the animal, and the app should block the flash when shooting. Also, when taking pictures of animals, they can move and blur the image. I hope the application will have a solution for this to analyze that animal more efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nguyen Duc Dang Khoa &ndash; s3891667</p>
<p>" Your project seems very interesting, and I would try the app when it is available in reality. But in my opinion, the alarm system needs to be enhanced so that there is a shorter way for the user to call for help immediately without taking a photo of the animal to pop up the call button. I hope that one day your project can become real, and I am looking forward to it."</p>
<p>Reply:</p>
<p>Thanks to my friend's opinion, I have realized some problems that I am having with my project. First, I should feed more information to the Learning Machine in the app to recognize the animal more easily without relying too much on the photo's quality. In that way, even if you have do not have a clear image, it still can vaguely detect the animal in the picture. I will also put on some policies while using the app to prevent people from intimidating wild animals. I will not tolerate any harmful action to the wildlife. If the user is using the app for the wrong purposes, our team can detect the toxic material they post, delete it and contact the nearest authority to prevent those actions. There is also a notification, and the app will not let the user use any feature as long as the phone's flashlight is on. I will also mention this in the policy, and if any user disobeys these rules, I will ban them from using the app. And as for khoa's request, I will also add another function that can turn on and off. When the user explores places like jungle or wildlife, they can turn on this feature; a call icon will appear on the screen and even the block screen. I have to admit I have not found out the best solution for this problem since the user might be too scared to do anything, but I find out one I will make changes to the project. And once again, thank you for giving me your opinion.</p>

<p><strong>V/ IT TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLOUD COMPUTING</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What does it do?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cloud computing is the provision of computing services through the Internet. To be precise, it is the means of supply according to the users' needs entirely over the Internet&mdash;the services including servers, storage, databases, software, networking, analytics, and intelligence. Anyone can store and access any file from anywhere as long as there is an Internet with Cloud Computing. Many famous services use Cloud Computing like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud. </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the likely impact?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing has brought many benefits in many fields. With the help of Cloud Computing, businesses and companies do not have to invest a load of money to build and maintain a host system to store information. Instead, they can pay a small amount of money for the cloud services they are using. It is economically efficient and prevents the distraction and errors that might happen while establishing their host system. Another benefit when using Cloud Computing is its flexibility in scale to satisfy the client's needs. As a company growing, day by day, more and more information needs to be store, and when using Cloud Computing services, companies can continue to save more data on Cloud as much as they like. Security is also another advantage of Cloud Computing. Many Cloud providers have their policy in storing data and investing the most advanced technology to secure any data on Cloud, so companies can trust them and continue to use their services. Moreover, Cloud companies can provide the user with massive resources in seconds, and they also ensure that the service's performance is always at its best. With all the advantages above, Cloud Computing has provided everyone a safe and fast working environment. Nowadays, everyone can work from home as long as they have an Internet connection. Especially since the pandemic, students and office workers have to work from home. But thanks to Cloud Computing, it is easy for students to access the resources for their assignments while adults can carry on their work like before.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How Cloud Computing affect you?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is undeniable that Cloud Computing has become an essential part of everyone's life; mine is no exception. As a university student, hence I have to do a lot of research, and without Cloud Computing to help store the data, it is hard for me to research without relying heavily on books. And since the Covid-19 I can only stay at home, and it is impossible to go outside. Another great use of Cloud Computing is storing heavy data. My family tends to take a lot of pictures while traveling or on special occasions. And after many years, the file has become very significant that it takes up a lot of storage on any advice, and sometimes we break the device and lose the data. So Cloud Computing has become an alternative way for us to store our memories. It lasts forever, and we can access it everywhere; it also frees a lot of storage for our devices. And lastly, Cloud Computing has a vital role in my project. Since my project has to store many data and enable the user to access it everywhere, it is crucial to use a Cloud service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MACHINE LEARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What does it do?</em></strong></p>
<p>Machine learning is a sub-field in Artificial Intelligence. It means that a machine can study based on the given Data with neither explicitly programmed nor human intervention. Through training, Machine Learning can predict or decide on their own. The growth of technology has resulted in more and more data that surpass the human capacity to handle them, so we need Machine Learning to help us. Machine Learning and Big Data have a codependent relationship. At the same time, Machine Learning is feed with info from big data; the actual value of Big Data comes from what Machine Learning has exploited. Machine Learning has many uses in life, such as image recognition, fraud detection, recommendation system; they can even help us diagnose diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer. There are several types of Machine Learning.</p>
<p><strong>Supervised learning:</strong>&nbsp;We give the machine example question and answer and expect the machine's outcome to predict and respond to future queries.</p>
<p><strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong>&nbsp;In contrast to supervised learning, the machine has to figure out the hidden structure of a data set without relying on any sample answer.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong>&nbsp;Same with unsupervised learning, the machine will not receive any sample answer but, they will receive feedback for any action, and they will adjust their response base on the positive or negative feedback.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What is the likely impact?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>With Machine Learning's popularity, it is hard to overlook that it has contributed many benefits for humanity. In medical, it is possible for AI to predict a heart attack with an accuracy of 80 percent, while a manual system can only reach 30 percent. It would theoretically give the patient four hours to act before the situation occurs. However, the prediction might depend on many other factors. For example, a Learning Machine is trained to calculate a man's heart, and the accuracy drops when calculating on women because the heart attack of men and women differ in some ways. So rely on the system alone sometimes can be false. Another example of future technology is self-driving cars. Many famous companies are trying to make self-driving vehicles available. Another means of transportation without humans driving it. They can automatically dodge the obstacle and can guide you safely to your destination. However, it is only a plan and might take a lot of effort and money to widely use this technology. And lastly, Machine Learning has helped us reduce the energy consumption from data centers. Before Machine Learning, the device has to process a lot of data, leading to overheating and releasing more carbon dioxide into the environment, affecting global warming. Now with Machine Learning, less energy is required less heat is produced in the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How Machine Learning affect you?</em></strong></p>
<p>Machine Learning has played an essential role not only in every technology company but in everyone's life. Growing up, I did not know about Machine Learning, nor how many things surround us use Machine Learning, but now the more I understand it, the more I feel blessed that Machine Learning exists. As a person who likes to take pictures sometimes, it is hard and time-consuming to tag all the friends in the photo. Still, with the help of image recognition from many social media apps, the system will recognize familiar friends and suggest tagging them.&nbsp; As this project proposes, image recognition has inspired me to create an app that can identify animals and plants; without the help of Machine Learning, turning my idea into reality would be impossible. Machine Learning also contributes a lot to major search engines such as Google or Bing. There is massive data on the internet nowadays, so searching for documents or information can be tricky because there are many similar words but different meanings. For example, "Java" has two implications one is a programming language, and the other is coffee. With the help of Machine Learning, the system can classify what person you are and suggest the search base on your personality. They also provide a lot of support in many fields, especially in health care. An average nurse spends 25% of their work time doing routine regulatory and administrative activities; however, with a machine's help, they can replace humans and do all the daily tasks. Another use of Machine Learning is riding apps like Grab or Gojek. Before technology, drivers were available everywhere; the only means of transportation besides buses were taxis or motorbike taxis. To travel, you have to depend a lot on the driver; sometimes, you might not catch a ride, or the driver is clueless about the destination, which is frustrating and time-consuming. But with the help of Machine Learning, not only can it help the user find the closest driver, but it can also suggest the shortest way. Overall, Machine Learning has come a long way and become an irreplaceable technology in our life.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of Covid-19, many people have had to work from home, and Chris Lovejoy was no exception. In this video, he will show us his daily life as a data scientist during the pandemic.&nbsp; After picking his favorite music, he begins to work. His first action before changing any code is git pull to update the newest version if someone modifies anything. By doing this, Chris Lovejoy avoids working on a different version with his co-workers. His current job requires him to test with different Learning Machine models and to check their performance.&nbsp; After experiencing many models, he will pick out the best one and store them as a pickle file for further testing. He also has a meeting with his team in the morning to update and figure out the team's obstacles. And then he carries on with his codes. As a data scientist, he has to gain more knowledge continuously, so he tunes in to one of his lectures to learn while having a break. Later in the afternoon, he has another meeting with his team to discuss a presentation that they have to do this week. Later that day, he has one last group session where they will communicate about the work and give each other advice. Furthermore, he said that the group session was the highlight of the day. Overall, Working from home can be very challenging since you cannot communicate probably, and there are many distractions. But Chris Lovejoy has proved that working from home can be as efficient as going to work. Many people think that his job is only about coding, but in reality, he has to communicate and understand others.</p>

Her day started after she wakes up, then she cleans herself and heads to study German for fifteen minutes. She also advises her viewers to form a habit by doing it in the morning. I feel like this is excellent advice because morning is the time we focus the most. Then she goes out for a quick exercise, and when she turns back, it is time for work. Before doing anything, she notes down her daily task on a random notepad to avoid forgetting her mission. Today, she has to address some PR comments, look into the problem that the feature she released yesterday is not working correctly, and write a document describe her second week working for the company. Every week she or her co-worker has to monitor the system, but this week is not her duty. Later she has a stand-up meeting with her team to discuss the team's daily and weekly tasks. After the meeting, she then carries on with her work, and until noon, she has a one-on-one meeting with the engineering manager to talk about her progress. And lastly, she tries to debug her task before finishing her work, which she amitted is challenging. Then she spends the rest of her day resting and enjoying herself.
